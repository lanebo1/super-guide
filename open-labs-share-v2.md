## The Problem: Skills Gap in Tech Education

> **60% of tech leaders** report that university graduates lack the practical skills needed for their first job.
> *(2023 Industry Skills Report)*

**Engineering challenges in education technology:**

- **Scalability bottlenecks** in traditional learning management systems
- **Limited real-world project experience** due to academic focus on theory
- **Inefficient mentor-learner matching** without automated skill assessment
- **Poor feedback loops** between industry needs and educational content

**Our engineering mission:** Build a distributed, scalable platform that efficiently connects industry experts with aspiring developers through hands-on technical projects.

---

## Our Technical Vision: Engineering Learning at Scale

**Open Labs Share** - A cloud-native, microservices-driven learning ecosystem with intelligent matching and AI-powered assistance.

**We transform learning through:**
- **Expert Content Pipeline:** Git-inspired versioning system for lab content with automated distribution
- **Learner Development Workflow:** CI/CD-like submission pipeline with automated validation and feedback routing
- **Intelligent Community:** ML-driven peer matching and reputation-based quality assurance systems
