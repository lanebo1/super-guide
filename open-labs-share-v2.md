# üì•API Gatewayüì§

**Nikita Maksimenko**

The API Gateway centrally coordinates frontend REST API requests, executes business logic, and routes them to backend microservices via gRPC.

---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->


## API Gateway: Core Responsibilities

- ‚ùå Problem: Multiple services to interact with
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ Solution: API Gateway service
- üåê **Centralized Entry Point**: Serves as the unified access layer for all client REST API requests
- üîÄ **Request Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice (`auth`, `user`, `article`, `lab`) via gRPC
- üîí **Authentication & Security**: Validates JWT tokens and user's permissions
- üìù **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Handles logging, request tracing, and error handling for all API traffic
- üß†‚öôÔ∏è **Business Logic Execution**: Aggregating data and enforcing business rules beyond simple routing


---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->

## API Gateway: Communication & Tech

- üì• Receive data from frontend via REST
    ‚§∑ REST is the simplest and most widely supported method for web communication
- üõ°Ô∏è Intercept incoming REST requests for authentication and authorization
    ‚§∑ Ensures secure access and centralized permission checks
- üîÄ Route requests internally to backend microservices via gRPC
    ‚§∑ gRPC provides high-speed, type-safe, and scalable service-to-service communication
- üì§ Return responses to the client through the API Gateway
    ‚§∑ Centralizes response handling and error management
- üßë‚Äçüíª Use Java 21, Spring Boot 3 (Web, AOP, Doc OpenAPI), gRPC
    ‚§∑ Ensures a secure, efficient, and maintainable technology stack for all platform components

---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->

## API Gateway: Problems & Solutions

- ‚ùå Too many services and people to communicate with
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ Create clear rules of communication and define issue execution order for efficient collaboration
- ‚ùå Unclear models from both frontend and backend
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ Establish detailed requirements for each request step to ensure consistency and clarity
- ‚ùå Lack of data checks on frontend
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ Use Jackson validators in request models to enforce data integrity before processing

# üöÄ DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure

**Kirill Efimovich - DevOps Engineer**

Our DevOps philosophy centers on ü§ñ automation, üì¶ consistency, and ‚ö° rapid, reliable delivery. We've built a robust CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure to support the entire development lifecycle, from code commit to deployment.

---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->

## DevOps: Primary Goals

- ü§ñ **Automate Everything**: Eliminate manual steps in building, testing, and deploying to increase efficiency and reduce human error.
- üì¶ **Consistent Environments**: Use Docker to ensure that what works on a developer's machine also works in production.
- ‚ö° **Enable Rapid Feedback**: Automatically deploy every merge to `main` to a live staging environment for immediate testing and user feedback.
- ü§ù **Streamline Collaboration**: Integrate project management automation to keep the team synchronized.

---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->

## DevOps: Tech Stack & Connections

A look at the tools that power our automated pipeline.

- **Automation:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose with Bake
- **Registry:** GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Infrastructure:** Self-hosted server with NGINX & HAProxy
- **Server setup:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, 6 CPUs, 16GB RAM, 240GB SSD
- **Networking:** CloudPub for external access



---
<!-- _class: compact-list -->

## DevOps: Problems & Solutions

- ‚ùå **Problem:** University network NAT blocked external access to our self-hosted server.
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ **Solution:** After issues with Cloudflare, we successfully used **CloudPub** to create a secure tunnel for public access.
- ‚ùå **Problem:** The initial CI/CD pipeline was complex and required many iterations to stabilize.
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ **Solution:** Through persistent, collaborative effort, we developed a set of reliable, modular GitHub Actions workflows.
- ‚ùå **Problem:** Risk of downtime during manual deployments.
    ‚§∑ ‚úÖ **Solution:** We fully automated the deployment process and are implementing a **Blue-Green strategy** to ensure zero-downtime updates.
